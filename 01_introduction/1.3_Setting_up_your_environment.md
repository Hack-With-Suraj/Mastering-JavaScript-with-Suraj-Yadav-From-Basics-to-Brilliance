# 1.3 Setting up your environment (browsers, editors, and tools)
To start developing with JavaScript, you need a few key ingredients:
A Web Browser: Any modern desktop, laptop, virtual machine, or even mobile device will do. You can use Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. These browsers are widely used and have excellent built-in developer tools, making them ideal for debugging JavaScript.

## IDE (Integrated Development Environment):
 You can use any IDE or code editor that supports JavaScript. A popular choice is Visual Studio Code, a free, open-source, cross-platform code editor with excellent JavaScript support and a vast ecosystem of plugins.

## Node.js:
 While Node.js isn’t specific to client-side JavaScript, it’s essential if you want to install libraries and tools (node packages) from the npm package manager. Node.js also allows you to execute JavaScript on the server side.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial:
