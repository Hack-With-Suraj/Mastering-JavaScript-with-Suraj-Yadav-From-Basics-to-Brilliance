# 2.6 Control Flow: If-Else and Switch Statements
## Understanding Control Flow
In JavaScript, control flow determines the order in which statements are executed. This allows you to make decisions and perform different actions based on specific conditions. Two fundamental control flow statements are if-else and switch.
## The if-else Statement
The if-else statement is used to execute different code blocks based on a condition. If the condition is true, one block of code is executed; otherwise, another block is executed.

### Basic Structure:
```
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```
```
Example:   
let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote yet.");
}
```

## Nested if-else Statements:
You can nest if-else statements within each other to create more complex decision-making structures.
Example:
```
let grade = 85;

if (grade >= 90) {
  console.log("Excellent!");
} else if (grade >= 80) {
  console.log("Very Good!");
} else if (grade >= 70) {
  console.log("Good!");
} else {
  console.log("Needs Improvement!");
}                                                                              

```
## The switch Statement
The switch statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of an expression.  
Basic Structure:
```
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to execute if expression equals value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to execute if expression equals value2
    break;
  // ...
  default:
    // Code to execute if   no case matches
}
```

Example:
```
let dayOfWeek = "Monday";
switch (dayOfWeek) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("It's a workday.");
    break;
  case "Friday":
    console.log("Almost the weekend!");
    break;
  case "Saturday":
  case "Sunday":
    console.log("Enjoy your weekend!");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("It's a regular weekday.");
}
   ```                                                   
Note: The break statement is essential to prevent the execution of subsequent cases if a match is found.

## Practice Questions:
1. Write an if-else statement to determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero.<br/>
2. Create a switch statement to check the user's input and print the corresponding day of the week.<br/>
3. Write a program that determines if a year is a leap year using an if-else statement.<br/>
4. Implement a menu-driven system using a switch statement to allow users to choose different options.<br/>
5. Create a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations using if-else statements.<br/>


Learning if else and switch are the first steps to be able to make your JavaScript program do fancy stuff.
