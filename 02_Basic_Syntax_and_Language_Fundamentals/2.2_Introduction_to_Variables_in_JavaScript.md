# 2.2 Introduction to Variables in JavaScript
## What are Variables?
Think of variables as containers that store data. In JavaScript, you use variables to hold different kinds of information, such as numbers, text (strings), true or false values (booleans), and more.
## Declaring Variables
To create a variable in JavaScript, you use the let or const keyword. This is called declaring the variable.
let: Used for variables whose values might change later.
const: Used for variables whose values should not change once they're set.

Example:
```
 let name = "Alice";  // Declares a variable named 'name' and assigns it the value "Alice" 

const age = 30; // Declares a constant named 'age' and assigns it the value 
```

## Assigning Values
Once you've declared a variable, you can assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).

Example:
```
let favoriteColor = "blue";
```
## Accessing Variable Values
To use the value stored in a variable, you simply refer to its name.

Example:
```
console.log(name);
```

When to use which:
var: Avoid using var in modern JavaScript.
let: Use let for variables that might change within a block.
const: Use const for variables that should not change.

Example:
```
// Using var
var x = 10;
x = 20; // Valid

// Using let
let y = 30;
y = 40; // Valid

// Using const
const z = 50;
z = 60; // Error: Cannot assign to constant variable
```
In summary:
var is generally discouraged due to its potential for unexpected behavior.
let is flexible and allows for reassigning values.
const is used for values that should remain constant throughout the program.
