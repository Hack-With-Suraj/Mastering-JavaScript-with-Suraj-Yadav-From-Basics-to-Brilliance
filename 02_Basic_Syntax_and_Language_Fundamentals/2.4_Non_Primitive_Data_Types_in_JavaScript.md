# 2.4 Non-Primitive Data Types in JavaScript
## Understanding Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types in JavaScript are complex data structures that can hold multiple values.
non-primitive data types are reference types. This means that variables holding non-primitive values don't store the values directly but rather store references to them.

### Common Non-Primitive Data Types:
#### Objects:
- Collections of key-value pairs.
- Used to represent real-world entities or complex data structures.
- Example: { name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York" }
#### Arrays:
- Ordered collections of values.
- Can contain elements of different data types.
- Example: [1, 2, 3, "apple"]
### Key Differences Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types:
### Assignment:
#### Primitive values:
 When you assign a primitive value (like a number or string) to a variable, it's like you're giving someone a piece of candy. You get your candy and they get their own.
#### Non-primitive values:
 If you are assigning a non-primitive value (e.g., object or array) to a variable, it's as if you're giving someone an access card to the chest full of treasures. They never receive the treasure, but they do get this key that enables them to obtain it.
#### Comparison:
Primitive values: Comparing primitive values is like comparing two candies. You look at them and see if they're the same.                                                                          
#### Non-primitive values:
 Comparing non-primitive values is like comparing two keys. You don't look at the keys themselves, but you check if they open the same treasure chest.

Example:
```
// Primitive data type (number)
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = num1;
num1 = 20;
console.log(num1); // Output: 20
console.log(num2); // Output: 10

// Non-primitive data type (object)
let obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
let obj2 = obj1;
obj1.name = "Bob";
console.log(obj1); // Output: { name: "Bob" }
console.log(obj2); // Output: { name: "Bob" }
```
In this example, num1 and num2 are primitive values, so changing num1 doesn't affect num2. However, obj1 and obj2 are non-primitive values (objects), so modifying obj1 also modifies obj2 because they both refer to the same object.

## Understanding Objects and Arrays in More Detail:
### Objects:
- Properties: Key-value pairs that define the characteristics of an object.
- Methods: Functions defined within an object that can be used to perform actions on the object.
```
// Objects
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York",

  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
  }
};

console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
console.log(person.age); // Output: 30
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
```
Note :- We are explaining about the function in detail in the third chapter.
### Arrays:
- Elements: Individual values stored in an array.
- Indexing: Accessing elements by their position (starting from 0).
- Methods: Various methods for manipulating arrays, such as push, pop, shift, unshift, slice, splice, join, reverse, sort, and more.
```
// Arrays
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(numbers[0]); // Output: 1
console.log(numbers[2]); // Output: 3

numbers.push(6); // Add 6 to the end of the array
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

numbers.pop(); // Remove the last element from the array
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

numbers.shift(); // Remove the first element from the array
console.log(numbers); // Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]

numbers.unshift(0); // Add 0 to the beginning of the array
console.log(numbers); // Output: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const slicedNumbers = numbers.slice(1, 3); // Create a new array from index 1 to 2 (exclusive)
console.log(slicedNumbers); // Output: [2, 3]

numbers.splice(2, 1); // Remove one element starting from index 2
console.log(numbers); // Output: [0, 2, 4, 5]

const joinedNumbers = numbers.join(", "); // Join the elements with a comma and space
console.log(joinedNumbers); // Output: 0, 2, 4, 5

numbers.reverse(); // Reverse the order of the elements
console.log(numbers); // Output: [5, 4, 2, 0]

numbers.sort(); // Sort the elements in ascending order
console.log(numbers); // Output: [0, 2, 4, 5]
```
understanding the differences between primitive and non-primitive data types, you can effectively work with complex data structures in your JavaScript programs.
