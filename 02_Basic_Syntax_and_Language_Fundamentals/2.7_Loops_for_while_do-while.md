# 2.7 Loops: for, while, do-while
## Understanding Loops
Loops allow for a block of code to be executed repeatedly until a given condition is met. It might be useful for tasks which require repetition or iteration. In JavaScript, we have three primary loop types: forwhiledo-while
### The for Loop
The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you need to repeat a block of code.
Basic Structure:
```
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to be executed
}
```
Example:
```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration " + (i + 1));
}
```
### The while Loop
The while loop is used when you don't know the exact number of repetitions beforehand. It continues to execute as long as a specified condition remains true.
Basic Structure:
```
while (condition) {
  // Code to be executed
}
```
Example:
```
let count = 1;
while (count <= 10) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
```
### The do-while Loop
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code inside the loop will be executed at least once.  
Basic Structure:
```
do {
  // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```
Example:
```
let number = 0;
do {
  console.log(number);
  number++;
} while (number < 5);
```
### Practice Questions:
1. Write a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 100.
2. Use a while loop to calculate the factorial of a given number.
3. Implement a guessing game using a while loop where the user tries to guess a random number.
4. Write a program that finds the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 using a for loop.
5. Create a do-while loop to prompt the user for input until they enter a valid number.

### Additional Tips:
- Be careful with infinite loops. Ensure that the condition in your loop eventually becomes false.
- Use break to exit a loop prematurely if needed.
- Consider using nested loops for more complex scenarios.
- Understanding these patterns and when to use each is how you can write more efficient, powerful JavaScript code.
